 There are 4 Projects in the Solution.
    I name the project as NL_Bank. 
      1.1 NL_Bank is Main Projects
	1.2 GenIBANProject is Project to Generate IBAN Number Automatically.  We have to wait for a few seconds to get generated IBAN Number back from website.
	1.3 CustomMessageBox is Project to display Message in the Projects
	1.4 Classlibrary_NL_Bank is Project to connect database model
 I have two main menu programs, one main menu for NL_Bank Employee, another main menu is  for Customer to deposit or transfer money themself.
 First, NL Bank Employee has to create Customer Account. This step will put details of customer and Employee can create User Name but let Customers keyin their passwords.
        There is initial Balance so I assume that it is first Deposit to new customer Bank Account so I deduct a deposit for initial Balance. NL Bank Employee can deposit 
 or transfer money for the customers if they come to the bank.
        After NL Bank Employee created customer bank accounts, the customer can use UserName and Password to do the transactions Themselves at any Kiosk in the NL Bank.
